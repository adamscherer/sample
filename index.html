							Protected against Pertussis?
						</h3>
						<p>In addition to infants and kindergartners, Immunization with Tdap is recommended for adults and adolescents who will have, or anticipate having, close contact with an infant aged <12 months. Tdap should ideally be administered at least two weeks before contact with the infant. For such patients, the interval between Td and Tdap may be as short as two years, and sometimes shorter. If you have just given birth, we recommend getting a Tdap vaccine as soon as possible. This will not interfere with breastfeeding. Ask your obstetrician if they can order it in the hospital!</p>
